# This is an application to help my GF to search on an Excel DB

This is a quick tool for a specific purpose and specific situation.

The idea is to search on specific columns in a DB a number and put it in a new Excel matching to get matching weights of molecules to characterize what molecule it's from the experiment.

This is normally done manually taking days, this only took 30 minutes to build and run (programming rocks!).
